	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to execute. It helps us understand how the performance of an algorithm scales with the input size. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, which means they can solve problems quickly even for large inputs.

    <p>
        Space Complexity is another important aspect of algorithm analysis. It evaluates how much memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem, typically as a function of the input size. In Big O notation, we represent space complexity as O(n), where 'n' is the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is particularly critical when dealing with limited memory resources.
